Miniburger 0.8.16
=================
One-level hamburger menu.

## How to show a hambuger menu

The hambuger menu is created by the layout `system/layouts/miniburger.html`. In order to use it you can do either of the following:

1. Rename it to `system/layouts/navigation.html`
2. In `system/layouts/header.html` change `$this->yellow->layout("navigation")` to `$this->yellow->layout("miniburger")`

## Installation

[Download extension](https://github.com/GiovanniSalmeri/yellow-miniburger/archive/master.zip) and copy zip file into your `system/extensions` folder. Right click if you use Safari.

This extension copies shamelessly from [Responsive Navigation Bar](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp) by W3Schools; see [Terms of service](https://www.w3schools.com/about/about_copyright.asp).
